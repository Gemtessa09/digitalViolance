# Project Title
# SafeNet Shield: A Digital Protection Platform for Women & Children

# 1. Project Description

SafeNet Shield is a web-based digital protection platform designed to address Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence (TFGBV) affecting women and children. The platform provides a safe, accessible, and user-centered environment where victims can report online abuse, learn digital safety practices, and access timely support services.

The system is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while Node.js with Express.js powers the backend, and MongoDB is used for secure and scalable data storage.

SafeNet Shield aims to bridge the gap between victims and support systems by offering anonymous reporting, digital safety education, and real-time assistance through a centralized digital solution.

# 2. Background and Context

With the rapid growth of internet access and social media platforms, women and children are increasingly exposed to online risks such as cyberbullying, online harassment, digital stalking, non-consensual sharing of images, and online exploitation.

In many developing regions, including vulnerable communities, these challenges are intensified by:

-Limited digital literacy

-Fear of retaliation

-Lack of confidential reporting mechanisms

-Inadequate access to legal and psychological support

-Weak enforcement of digital safety policies

SafeNet Shield was conceived to respond to these challenges by providing a secure, trusted, and easy-to-use digital protection platform.

# 3. Problem Statement (Current Existing Problems)

Despite the increasing prevalence of TFGBV, several critical problems still exist:

Lack of Safe Reporting Channels
Many victims do not know where or how to report online abuse safely. Existing reporting mechanisms are often complicated, inaccessible, or unsafe.

Fear of Exposure and Stigma
Women and children often avoid reporting abuse due to fear of shame, retaliation, or being identified publicly.

Limited Awareness of Digital Safety
A large number of users lack basic knowledge about online privacy, cyber risks, and how to protect themselves digitally.

Delayed or No Access to Support Services
Victims struggle to reach law enforcement, child protection services, or NGOs in a timely manner.

Poor Documentation of Evidence
Victims often lose or fail to preserve digital evidence required for legal action.

# 4. Problem Addressed by SafeNet Shield

-SafeNet Shield directly addresses the above challenges by:

-Providing a secure and anonymous reporting system

-Offering digital safety education tailored for women and children

-Enabling safe storage of evidence for future reference

-Connecting users with support services and emergency contacts
